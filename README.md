# MFCCs_Code
MFCCs are features of a purely acoustic nature that account for physical sound patterns and are typically used for automatic speech recognition tasks. 

These coefficients take into account the (non-linear) perception of sound by the human ear and are used to verify the similarity or distinction of sounds in the segment and prosody domains.
